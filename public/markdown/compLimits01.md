### Winter Conditions During Past El Niños

The maps above illustrate the winter conditions during the record breaking El Niño of 2015-16. The entire region was warmer than normal, and precipitation was generally near to above normal. This aligns with the weather patterns typically seen during El Niño winters and those expected this winter. Snowfall signals varied across the region

While New England, New York, and northern Pennsylvania saw below-normal snowfall, southeastern Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and the Mid-Atlantic saw above-normal snowfall.

Each El Niño is different and other factors can affect winter conditions, such pre-exisiting global snow cover patterns or climate variability associated with the [Arctic Oscillation](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/ao/) and [North Atlantic Oscillation](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/pna/nao.shtml). For instance, during the winter of 1965-1966, expected El Niño precipitation was subdued due to a strong negative North Atlantic Oscillation. These patterns are less able to be forecast far in advance compared to El Niño, meaning it is uncertain how much they will affect the upcoming winter.
