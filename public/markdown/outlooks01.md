### Winter Temperature and Precipitation Outlooks

As of mid-October, [NOAA's winter outlooks](https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/winter-outlook-favors-warmer-temperatures-for-much-of-us)(right) show that above-normal temperatures are favored for New England, New York, the northern half of Pennsylvania, and northern New Jersey. Equal chances of below-, near-, or above-normal temperatures are forecast for the rest of the region. Meanwhile, the precipitation outlook indicates that Delaware, much of Maryland and New Jersey, southeastern Pennsylvania, and portions of West Virginia could have above-normal precipitation, while equal chances are predicted for the rest of the Northeast. The seasonal outlooks combine many factors including dynamical models, the effects of long-term trends, and soil moisture, in addition to past El Niño patterns. Therefore, they may not match typical El Niño conditions exactly.
