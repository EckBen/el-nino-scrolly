### Coastal Storms

Several research studies have noted an increased frequency of East Coast storms during El Niño winters. These storms, known as nor’easters, have a number of coastal impacts, ranging from beach erosion and high winds to heavy snowfall and precipitation.

Storms that follow a classic nor’easter track from south of Cape Hatteras along the East Coast are the main contributor to this increase. Hirsch et al. (2001) found an additional two storms with this track occur during El Niño winters compared to other winters. Strong El Niño events are particularly associated with this increase.

Significant snow storms such as the Blizzard of ‘58 and a second March 1958 nor’easter occurred in conjunction with El Niño conditions, as did the February 2003 Presidents' Day Storm. Storms such as the \"Perfect Storm\" in October 1991 brought 15 to 30 foot waves to coastal New England during a strong El Niño. More recently, the [blizzard of January 2016](http://www.nrcc.cornell.edu/services/special/reports/blizzard2016.pdf) severely impacted the Northeast during one of the strongest El Niños on record.
