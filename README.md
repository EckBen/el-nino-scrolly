# El Ni√±o - A Scrolly Generator Example

An example of how to build and inject a generated scrolly '*.dist.js' file into a React project.

The keys to the injection are 'useScript.js', it's usage in 'App.js', and the return `<div id='scrolly'></div>` in 'App.js'.

The 'el_nino' directory contains the project files that were used to generate 'el_nino.dist.js' using the **scrolly-generator** project [located here]([https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/be99](https://github.com/EckBen/scrolly-generator).
